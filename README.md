# GradientBoostingClassifier
### 🌲 Gradient Boosting Classifier Project This repository demonstrates how to build and evaluate a classification model using GradientBoostingClassifier from scikit-learn — a powerful ensemble learning method that combines weak learners to create a strong predictive model.
### 📊 Project Overview
##### Gradient Boosting is an advanced machine learning technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors of the previous ones. In this project, we apply it to a real-world classification problem to:

- Preprocess and explore the dataset

- Train and tune a GradientBoostingClassifier

- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

= Interpret feature importance to understand model decisions

### ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python

- scikit-learn

- pandas, NumPy

- matplotlib, seaborn

### 🎯 Outcome
- The project highlights how gradient boosting can achieve high accuracy and robustness in classification tasks, especially when tuned properly. It also demonstrates how to balance model performance and interpretability.
